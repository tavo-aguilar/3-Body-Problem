# 3-Body-Problem
3 body problem with modified mass of Jupiter


## Overview
This problem is aimed to predict the position of three different bodies of mass (in this case the Sun, Earth, and Jupiter) given an initial and final time. While we do have equations to fully predict the motion of two gravitating masses, analytical tools fall short when facing more populated syestems. It is not possible to derive a general formula for three or more gravitating objects due to the amount of unknown variables an n-body system contains. We can start with the standard formula for two gravitating objects:
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
